Steps to install in your Linux machine:
1) Download all the files from 'main' branch, and treat this to be your mother folder 
2) Download all the files from 'run' branch
3) Create a folder named 'run', and keep all the downloaded files from the 'run' branch inside it
4) There should be 'aerosol.rar' file (inside the files in 'run' branch), which needs to be unzipped
5) When all the files and folders are available and unzipped (if needed), install by 'configure' and 'compile' as you do for installing any versions of WRF
6) The required PIEKTUK-D files and codes are available in 'run', 'Registry', and 'phys' folders
